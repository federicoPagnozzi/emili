============

```emili``` is an algorithmic framework to instantiate several different 
optimization algorithms to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. 
The EMILI framework has been designed to be used in automatic algorithm design
systems that use a grammar based method to generate algorithms. To this end, 
the EMILI framework uses a parser to instantiate algorithms at run time.
The framework is focused on the implementation of single solution SLS algorithms
and in particular hybrid stochastic local search algorithms.

### Usage ###

emili INSTANCE_FILE_PATH PROBLEM < ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION > [-it|-ro time] [rnds seed] [ps]

#### Examples ####

##### First improvement local search to solve the permutation flowshop problem with the makespan objective #####

Let's say we want to solve the instance Ta086 of the Taillard benchmark 
considering the makespan objective. In particular, we want to run a simple 
first improvement local search that explores the insert neighborhood and 
generates the initial solution using the NEH heuristic. Then the commandline 
would be the following:

```
emili Ta086.txt PFSP_MS first neh locmin insert
```

Here the problem "PFSP_MS" indicates the makespan objective of the permutation flowshop problem and 
locmin is a termination criterion that stops the execution when the local search cannot 
find an improving solution in the current iteration. The neighborhood "insert" is the generic 
insert neighborhood that does not implement the Taillard's accelerations. The accelerated 
insert neighborhood is called "cstainsert".

##### Running IGirms #####

Now we want to solve the same instance but we want to use IGirms, the algorithm presented 
in the paper referenced in the [First Section](https://github.com/federicoPagnozzi/emili#emili).

```
emili Ta086.txt PFSP_MS ils first csfrb5 msorlocmin 77 cstainsert true rsls 1 best random locmin cstainsert pmetro 4.6512 0.9837 0.0234 321
```

This iterated greedy algorithm uses the FRB5 heuristic to generate the initial solution,
a first improvement local search, an iterated greedy and a Metropolis acceptance criterion. 
The local search explores the insert neighborhood and stops after it cannot
improve the current solution or 77 iterations. The iterated greedy perturbation removes 
one job and uses a best improvement local search to improve the partial solution. 

### How to compile ###
Use cmake for the configuration and then make.

An example: 

*from the source dir

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ cmake ../

$ make

### How to start contributing ###

1) Create a subdir for your problem.
2) Create classes for your problem and solution ( extend the classes Problem and Solution).
3) Create classes for the algorithmic components and/or 
   algorithm templates you want to use to generate algorithms. 
4) Create a Builder to tell the framework how to load a problem instance 
   and how to instantiate the components you created.
5) Use the framework to instantiate algorithms to solve your problem!

In the third Chapter of my PhD thesis ([available here](https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/294557/4/thesis.pdf)) you can learn how the framework is structured
and how to add components and templates.
Check the examples in the template dir to have a quick idea of what to do.
Check the components implemented for the permutation flowshop problem 
to learn more (unfortunately, the code there may not be commented).
For any question, feel free to contact me to the address written below.

New source code created in subdirectories, like the template dir, 
needs to be added to the list of source files in the CMakeList.txt file.
See the commented code at line 5 of CMakeList.txt for an example.

Please, do not modify the main classes in any way.
The framework is made to be interoperable, flexible and modular.
Any change you may do to the main classe may break these properties.
If you discover a bug or want to propose an improvement, feel free
to contact me at federico.pagnozzi@ulb.be
