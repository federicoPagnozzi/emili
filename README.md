emili
============

```emili``` is an algorithmic framework to instantiate several different 
optimization algorithms to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. 
The EMILI framework has been designed to be used in automatic algorithm design
systems that use a grammar based method to generate algorithms. To this end, 
the EMILI framework uses a parser to instantiate algorithms at run time.
The framework is focused on the implementation of single solution SLS algorithms
and in particular hybrid stochastic local search algorithms.

### Usage ###

EMILI INSTANCE_FILE_PATH PROBLEM < ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION > [-it|-ro time] [rnds seed] [ps]

### How to compile ###
Use cmake for the configuration and then make.

An example: 

*from the source dir

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ cmake ../

$ make

### How to start contributing ###

1) Create a subdir for your problem.
2) Create classes for your problem and solution ( extend the classes Problem and Solution).
3) Create classes for the algorithmic components and/or 
   algorithm templates you want to use to generate algorithms. 
4) Create a Builder to tell the framework how to load a problem instance 
   and how to instantiate the components you created.
5) Use the framework to instantiate algorithms to solve your problem!

In the third Chapter of my PhD thesis ([available here](https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/294557/4/thesis.pdf)) you can learn how the framework is structured
and how to add components and templates.
Check the examples in the template dir to have a quick idea of what to do.
Check the components implemented for the permutation flowshop problem 
to learn more (unfortunately, the code there may not be commented).
For any question, feel free to contact me to the address written below.

New source code created in subdirectories, like the template dir, 
needs to be added to the list of source files in the CMakeList.txt file.
See the commented code at line 5 of CMakeList.txt for an example.

Please, do not modify the main classes in any way.
The framework is made to be interoperable, flexible and modular.
Any change you may do to the main classe may break these properties.
If you discover a bug or want to propose an improvement, feel free
to contact me at federico.pagnozzi@ulb.ac.be
